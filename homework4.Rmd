#The function
```{r FinalFunction inputdata}
sampletake <- function(n, nsamp, dist) {
  
  ##n = sample size, nsamp = number of sample repeats, dist = distribution type, accepts either "n" for normale or "e" for exponential
  
  ##start IF statement for plotting samplepool histograms
  if (dist == "n") 
  {
    samplepool <- rnorm(n, 50, 4) 
    hist(samplepool, main = paste("Histogram of Normal samplepool"), n, col = "red")
  }
  else if (dist == "e")
  {
    samplepool <- rexp(n)
    hist(samplepool, main = paste("Histogram of Exponential samplepool"),n, col = "red")
  }
  ##end IF statement
  sampleSD <- sd(samplepool)
  samplemean <- mean(samplepool)
  ##we must initalize the vector with the correct size before using it.
  samplecontainer <- numeric(nsamp)
  
  ##start FOR loop
  for (i in 1:nsamp){
    thissample <- sample(samplepool, size = length(samplepool), replace = TRUE)
    samplecontainer[i] <- mean(thissample)
  }
  ##end FOR loop
  
  ##start IF statement for plotting bootstrap histograms
  if (dist == "n") 
  {
    hist(samplecontainer, main = paste("Normal distribution bootstrap"), n, col = "green")
  }
  else if (dist == "e")
  {
    hist(samplecontainer, main = paste("Exponential distribution bootstrap"), n, col = "green")
  }
  
  return(c(sampleSD, samplemean, samplecontainer))
}
inputdata <- sampletake(100,100,"n")
inputdata <- sampletake(100,100,"e")
```

## Explanation

n = sample size

nsamp = number of sample repeats

dist = distribution type NOTE: accepts either "n" for normale or "e" for exponential, quotation marks MUST be included

From the above histograms we can see that each of the samples taken still cluster around the mean in an approximately normal fashion.

More importantly this holds true for both a normally distributed population and an exponentially distributed population
